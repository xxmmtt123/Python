# Red Wine Quality Analysis
This is an analysis of which variables affect the quality of red wine. I will use machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

The dataset is available from the UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

The dataset contains 12 variables and 1,599 observations.
